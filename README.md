# percolator-oracle-keeper

Production-grade oracle keeper for [Percolator](https://github.com/dcccrypto/percolator-launch) — pushes price feeds to Percolator devnet markets via `PushOraclePrice` + `KeeperCrank`.

## What It Does

- **Multi-source price failover**: Pyth Hermes → Jupiter → DexScreener → mainnet CA lookup
- **Staleness detection**: alerts if price hasn't updated in configurable threshold (default 30s)
- **Circuit breaker**: rejects price moves > 10% per update (configurable); a sustained move confirms after 3 consecutive trips, and every published mark is rate-limited to ±30% of every mark in force during the trailing hour — sub-threshold steps included (a larger move advances to the band edge, is held there — re-pushed unchanged so the oracle stays fresh — and continues as older marks leave the window)
- **Health endpoint**: `/health` for Railway/monitoring with per-market stats
- **Graceful shutdown** with drain on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- **Supabase auto-discovery**: automatically cranks newly-created markets
- **HYPERP oracle mode**: cranks DEX-pool-based oracle markets (PumpSwap, Raydium, Meteora)
- **Wallet balance guard**: pauses pushes if keeper wallet goes below threshold
- **Oracle authority verification**: skips markets where the keeper isn't the oracle authority

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- A Solana keypair with oracle authority over the target markets
- RPC endpoint (Helius recommended for devnet)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env

## Deployment (Railway)

This service is deployed to Railway as `oracle-keeper` (service ID: `8bcc8946`).

Required Railway environment variables:
- `RPC_URL` — Helius devnet RPC
- `ADMIN_KEYPAIR` — JSON keypair array
- `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — for market auto-discovery
- `HEALTH_AUTH_TOKEN` — for secured health checks

## Devnet v2.1 fresh-ID cutover: two keepers

v2.1 ships as a fresh program-ID set; the ETDLAdi world is not upgraded and its markets become close-only.
The program set is chosen by one explicit switch, `KEEPER_DEVNET_V21` (`src/program-ids.ts`):

| `KEEPER_DEVNET_V21` | wrapper / stake / matcher / nft | default registry (Railway) |
|---|---|---|
| unset / `0` (default) | `ETDLAdi…` / `VmpVUArR…` / `EDKKgRaV…` / `EMYT15LZ…` (pinned literals, independent of the SDK defaults) | `/data/registry.relaunch.json` |
| `1` | `5NGgnU2j…` / `A6DVNubv…` / `DfTxJUT5…` / `DWUNq2iY…` | `/data/registry.v21.json`, seeded from `deploy/registry.v21.seed.json` (TO-FILL from the Phase 3 `newmarkets` output) |

- The existing relaunch service (`relaunch-live`) keeps running unchanged with the switch off, so v1 markets keep
  oracle pushes and cranks and their exits keep working.
- v2.1 runs as a SECOND Railway service from the same image with `KEEPER_DEVNET_V21=1`, its own `/data` volume and
  `WRAPPER_PROGRAM_ID=5NGgnU2j315Ci2tso8VJDEthaVExuiKG3tn4xnur28xe` (the launcher requires it). One replica per service.
- A v2.1 ID without the switch, or a v1 ID with it, fails boot. A registry is tagged `"programSet": "v21"`; each keeper
  refuses to boot or hot-reload the other world's registry. The register-poll owner filter follows the selected wrapper.

## Architecture

Previously part of `percolator-launch/bots/oracle-keeper/`. Extracted to standalone repo for cleaner architecture. The oracle-keeper is a backend service; the frontend lives in [percolator-launch](https://github.com/dcccrypto/percolator-launch).

## Chart tick publisher (optional)

When `TICK_INGEST_URL` and `TICK_INGEST_KEY` are both set, each cycle's *landed* pushes are POSTed
(`authorization: Bearer <key>`) as wire v1 `{v:1,src:"keeper",sentMs,ticks:[{slab,assetIndex,slot,landedMs,markE6,oracleE6}]}`
(max 200 ticks/request; `markE6` = published AuthMark, `oracleE6` = raw pool price or null). Fire-and-forget with a
single request in flight (extra batches are dropped and counted), `TICK_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT_MS` timeout (default 1500).
Counters appear under `tickPublisher` in `/health`. Unset = no-op; on-chain behaviour is never affected.

## v2.1 (P2b) layer — feature-detected, no-op on today's programs

The keeper carries the client side of the v2.1 wrapper (percolator-prog #524/#525/#526) behind a feature
gate (`src/cross-cluster/p2b-feature.ts`). There is no on-chain version byte, so `P2B_FEATURES=auto`
(default) runs one cached probe: a SIMULATED tag-103 (`VaultLpAllocate`) on a bound market.
`InvalidInstructionData` means the program predates P2b (cached 6 h, logged once, everything below stays
OFF); any `Custom(n)` (including 100 = no room) or success means supported. `on` skips the probe, `off`
never creates the loop.

When supported (tick every `P2B_TICK_MS`, one batched snapshot read per tick):

- **Tag 103 allocation cranks** (`p2b-allocate.ts`): per bound, Live market with no senior draw
  outstanding, paced ~60 s +-25%, simulated first, sent only on a clean simulation (`Custom(100)` = skip).
- **Tag 104 AdlWindDown** (`p2b-wind-down.ts`): for ADL reduce-only assets, one arming call per episode,
  then closes of the reduce-only side's legs once the episode expired or the side is dust; mark-age and
  per-cycle bounds; refusals 21/27/16/22 are classified and counted.
- **Hedged-lockout alert** (`p2b-hedged-lockout.ts`): both sides of a growth asset >= 90% of N_cap while the
  vault LP is within 3% of flat.
- **R3-M1** (`p2b-earn-gap.ts`): `/health` gains `earnVaults[]` (par - E3 gap per non-bound Earn vault,
  bigints as strings) and an alert when the gap exceeds `EARN_GAP_ALERT_BPS` for `EARN_GAP_ALERT_CYCLES`;
  the refresh prune budget no longer caps below the positioned set.

Independent of the gate: tag 78 on a bound vault appends `[7]` ext and `[8]` vault LP once the registry ext
flag (byte 161) is set (it is 0 on every pre-P2b program). See `.env.example` for every knob.

## v2.2 keeper (KEEPER_V22, default OFF)

Entry point is `src/cross-cluster.ts` (the Railway / launchd launcher runs `tsx src/cross-cluster.ts`; `src/index.ts` is not the live entry).
Everything below is flag-gated and default OFF: with no `KEEPER_V22*` variable set the v2.2 layer is never created,
the legacy cranker / fee job / vault-LP cranker take their old paths, and `/health` gains no key.

**SDK pin.** `@percolatorct/sdk` = `github:dcccrypto/percolator-sdk#ecb6215ec634e2a284bcc0f409c4ca5df6cb43a1`
(percolator-sdk#406, branch `feat/v22-sdk`: `LAYOUT_V22` variant B, VERSION-keyed layout guard, v2.2 builders, compute presets).
`@solana/web3.js` is 1.99.0 (the SDK's peer). To move the pin: change the ref in `package.json`, `pnpm install`, `npm install --package-lock-only`.

**Layout.** `market-layout.ts` keeps one table; the variant-B row (`v2.2-b`: group 806, slot 2,629, leg 217, portfolio 10,603, VERSION 19)
is derived from the SDK's `LAYOUT_V22` and refused if the two ever disagree. A VERSION the SDK has no table for, a length that matches no row,
a bad magic or a wrong kind is a loud error: counted (`layout-guard-metrics.ts`), logged once, `/health` `layoutGuard` + `status: degraded-markets`. No silent fallback.

| flag | default | what |
|---|---|---|
| `KEEPER_V22` | off | master switch |
| `KEEPER_V22_DRY_RUN` | off | simulate and log "would send", send nothing (also implied by `DRY_RUN`) |
| `KEEPER_V22_TICK_MS` | 20000 | loop tick |
| `KEEPER_V22_FEE_CRANK_BOND` | off | tag 78 on bond markets: LP crank (tag 5) first, then 78 with ext + writable LP + tranche |
| `KEEPER_V22_SWEEP` | off | positioned-refresh sweep for variant-B markets, leg-weight budget (3 + legs), heaviest first |
| `KEEPER_V22_SETTLE_PAIRING` | prefer | `off` / `prefer` / `strict`; acts only with the sweep on. See `v22/settle-pairing.ts` |
| `KEEPER_V22_ACCRUE_ANCHORS` | none | `market:flatPortfolio,...` accrue-only crank targets (else discovered) |
| `KEEPER_V22_HOLDING_RENT` / `_RENT_CADENCE_SLOTS` | off / 9000 | tag 106 on rent markets |
| `KEEPER_V22_DUST_SWEEP` | off | tag 118 (own flag; keep off on a wrapper without the bilateral fix) |
| `KEEPER_V22_G9` | off | tag 111 propose -> 9,000 slots -> draw, restore |
| `KEEPER_V22_G9_DRY_RUN` | **on** | G9 logs only until set to `off` |
| `KEEPER_V22_G9_ALLOW_ANY_ORACLE_MODE` | off | skip the Hybrid-only gate (devnet testing) |
| `KEEPER_V22_G9_DRAW_CAP_ATOMS` | u64 max | cap passed to draw / restore |
| `KEEPER_V22_MAINNET_BUILD` | off | G9 modes 0/2 pass the allowlist PDA + leg accounts |
| `KEEPER_V22_STAKE_SYNC` / `_INTERVAL_MS` | off / 60000 | stake v5 tag 31 |
| `KEEPER_V22_EARN_EXIT` | off | tag 77 on `keeper_ok` requests, only on a loss-current book |
| `VAULT_LP_LONE_CRANK` | on | `off` suppresses the lone vault-LP crank after every landed push (works without `KEEPER_V22`) |

**SETTLE_PAIRING.** Engine tag 5 on a portfolio settles only that portfolio, then accrues; a loss is booked at once, counterparties' gains
only when they are settled. The LP settled alone at a peak strands value. Policy: the round tracks which counterparties ACTUALLY settled
(landed refresh, or the program said "already current", Custom(22)). The LP tx is sent only if every positioned counterparty settled, or under
`prefer` when the only misses are portfolios the program REFUSED (band 104/111/112/113, hard refusal; counted in `unpairedLpSettles`);
`strict` holds the LP in that case. A counterparty tx that did not LAND holds the LP in both modes: there is no "force after N rounds".
A multi-tx round sends the counterparty txs first (parallel, pushes held) and the LP tx LAST, only inside `maxGapSlots` (8); a round that
exceeds it backs off 1 then 2 rounds (counted `gapBackoffRounds`) instead of re-sending phase 1 every tick.
A refused refresh is isolated (pruned, the rest re-sent) and the portfolio is quarantined (150 slots for a band state, 1,500 for a hard refusal).
Accrue-only: the no-observation crank does NOT accrue (Custom(22) unless already accrued); an observation crank accrues through whichever portfolio it
targets. The accrue goes through the KEEPER'S OWN flat portfolio when one exists (never a user's; verified by the program: a NoAction crank succeeds iff it accrued),
else through the tx's first counterparty (counted `counterpartyAccrues`). A landed Custom(22) on the accrue (a parallel tx accrued the same slot) means "already accrued": re-sent refresh-only.
The observation crank carries the Hybrid oracle leg accounts (without them the wrapper answers NotEnoughAccountKeys).
Tag 78 runs at the END of a paired round (alone, the LP was just settled), tag 106 rent settles ride the round in place of that portfolio's refresh
(the sweep-off timer paths are the only lone ones, and exist only without pairing). Any LP-alone settle that remains (78 timer path without the sweep, `prefer` overflow) is counted.

LP protection latency. The 1.5 s lone LP crank is suppressed on v2.2 markets while sweep + pairing are on, so the LP's own senior-draw / liquidation protection
waits for the next round: up to one crank cycle (`CRANK_INTERVAL_MS`, default 20 s) plus the round (about 1-5 s). Exception: on every landed push the v2.2 layer checks
the LP (senior draw pending, or equity <= 20% of capital: a coarse heuristic, the program decides) and, if so, runs a full PAIRED round immediately (about one round, 1-5 s). A protective
round may go with phase-1 failures but still puts the LP last in a tx WITH counterparties, never alone. No lone LP crank is reintroduced.

What it cannot guarantee: multi-tx rounds are not atomic (expected gap 1-4 slots, cap 8; funding/rent keep accruing, other writers' pushes can move K); only a single-tx
round is exactly atomic; anyone can still crank the LP alone (tag 5 is permissionless); the positioned set is a read; a portfolio the program keeps refusing can never be settled by
any keeper action (`prefer` counts it, `strict` freezes the LP until it clears, see `quarantinedNow`); beyond `maxTxsPerRound` (16) `prefer` settles the LP with counterparties unvisited
(counted) and `strict` skips the LP that round; the accrue-through-a-counterparty fallback settles that counterparty alone at the new K for the round's duration; the LP's rent is not settled under pairing
(rent is index-based and timing-invariant). Defence in depth: the engine fix is separate.

Env parsing is STRICT: an unrecognised value of any `KEEPER_V22*` variable or `VAULT_LP_LONE_CRANK` stops the keeper at startup (on/1/true/yes, off/0/false/no).

Every v2.2 send is simulated first (`v22/exec.ts`); refusals are logged by name (`PriceBandPinned(104)`, `InsuranceReadingsDiverged(44)`); band states 104/111/112/113 are expected, counted, never alerted.
