/**
 * cross-cluster/recovery-cranker.ts
 *
 * Periodic maintenance crank: keeps each registry market's engine-side
 * accrual state (`asset.slot_last` / `header.current_slot`) from drifting
 * too far behind the live chain slot.
 *
 * Why this exists (root cause, verified on-chain 2026-07-06):
 *   The cross-cluster oracle loop (auth-mark-pusher.ts) only ever calls
 *   PushAuthMark, which updates the wrapper's oracle profile (mark_ewma_e6,
 *   oracle_target_price_e6, ...). It never touches the ENGINE's accrual
 *   state. `header.current_slot` only advances inside
 *   `accrue_asset_to_not_atomic`, which runs on a `PermissionlessCrank` or a
 *   trade/settle instruction — never on PushAuthMark.
 *
 *   Once ANY such instruction lands after a long gap, `header.current_slot`
 *   jumps to the live slot (uncapped), but `asset.slot_last` only advances by
 *   `max_accrual_dt_slots` (500 on these markets) per call. Until
 *   `asset.slot_last` catches back up, `asset_is_loss_stale()` reads true and
 *   every RISK-INCREASING trade (new opens / adding to a position) fails with
 *   `Custom(21)` (`PercolatorError::EngineLockActive`, mapped from the
 *   engine's `V16Error::LockActive` in `trade_preflight_risk_gate`).
 *   Risk-decreasing trades (closes) are not gated by this specific check, but
 *   the gap only ever grows while nothing cranks the market, so left alone a
 *   market eventually accumulates enough drift to affect other staleness
 *   gates too (`reject_exposed_target_effective_lag_view`, B-settlement
 *   chunks, etc). This loop prevents the drift from ever growing large by
 *   touching every market on a steady cadence.
 *
 * What it does:
 *   Every `intervalMs` (default 20s), fire one `PermissionlessCrank`
 *   per registry market, targeting that market's matcher-enabled ("LP
 *   vault") portfolio — any account whose stored `market` field matches the
 *   slab works, but the LP portfolio is a stable, market-owned account that
 *   won't disappear if a user closes their position, so it's the safest
 *   fixed target.
 *
 *   v16-migration wire (VERSION 18, integration `a9318945`, dcccrypto/
 *   percolator-prog @ `sync/integration-v16`): the old caller-chosen
 *   `action`/`assetIndex`/`recoveryReason` fields are GONE. The wrapper's
 *   handler (`handle_permissionless_crank_zero_copy`, v16_program.rs) no
 *   longer lets the caller pick an action at all — the engine's
 *   `AutoCrankPlanV16` selector does that internally. What the caller now
 *   supplies is a bounded set of `CrankObservationHint { asset_index,
 *   oracle_accounts }` — raw evidence hints naming which assets it has
 *   fresh price/funding evidence for, and how many trailing oracle
 *   AccountInfos (if any) that evidence occupies in the instruction's
 *   account list.
 *
 *   This loop sends exactly one hint, `{ assetIndex: 0, oracleAccounts: 0 }`
 *   — these are single-asset (asset_index 0) markets on AUTH_MARK oracle
 *   mode (the cross-cluster oracle loop only ever pushes PushAuthMark, see
 *   above), so `hybrid_effective_price_for_crank_view` takes its
 *   `profile_is_auth_mark` branch: the crank price comes straight from the
 *   wrapper's own committed `mark_ewma_e6` (set by the last PushAuthMark),
 *   with NO external oracle account reads at all — `oracle_accounts: 0` is
 *   therefore not an empty/placeholder hint, it is the CORRECT declared
 *   count for this asset's oracle mode, and matches
 *   `ACCOUNTS_PERMISSIONLESS_CRANK_BASE` (owner/market/portfolio only, no
 *   oracle tail). Sending the hint (rather than an empty `observations: []`)
 *   is what makes the engine actually walk this asset's per-hint
 *   oracle-reading loop and call `accrue_asset_to_not_atomic` for it — an
 *   empty observations array would still satisfy a market already in
 *   Recovery mode (mode==2 short-circuits before consuming any hint) but
 *   would do NO accrual work at all on a Live-mode market, defeating this
 *   loop's entire purpose. `nowSlot: 0n` remains correct: the wrapper
 *   authenticates against `Clock::get()` via `authenticated_slot_or_fallback`
 *   regardless of the caller-supplied value (only used as a fallback if the
 *   Clock sysvar read itself fails).
 *
 * Deliberately separate from the oracle push loop:
 *   - Independent interval (crank only needs to run every ~10-30s; the
 *     oracle push runs every ~0.5-7s and must not be slowed down by this).
 *   - Independent errors — a crank failure never touches oracle-push state.
 *   - One transaction per market per cycle, fire-and-forget (no confirm
 *     await), same as the push loop's style.
 *
 * Refreshing positioned portfolios (2026-09-28):
 *   The accrual crank above moves K/F, and every such move marks the whole
 *   positioned cohort stale (`stale_account_count_<side> =
 *   stored_pos_count_<side>`). Until each positioned portfolio is refreshed
 *   the market reads `loss_stale_active` and risk-increasing trades revert
 *   Custom(21). The accrual crank only refreshes the account it targets, so a
 *   market with any third-party position stayed loss-stale forever. Each cycle
 *   now sends, in ONE transaction:
 *     [bounded catch-up cranks if behind] -> accrue(LP, observation)
 *       -> refresh(p) with NO observation for every positioned portfolio p
 *          (non-LP first, LP last)
 *   The refreshes must share the accrual's slot: a no-observation crank is
 *   rejected (Custom(22)) while a mark/funding move is still pending. The
 *   transaction is simulated first; refreshes the engine rejects (e.g. a side
 *   the accrual did not re-stale selects NoAction -> Custom(22)) are pruned,
 *   and the simulated post-state confirms the market ends not loss-stale. See
 *   positioned-refresh.ts for the engine references. (The older note here
 *   that crank instructions cannot share a transaction predates the v18
 *   auto-crank planner; measured on devnet, the sequence above lands clean.)
