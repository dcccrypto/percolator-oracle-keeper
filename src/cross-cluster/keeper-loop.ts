/**
 * cross-cluster/keeper-loop.ts
 *
 * Production keeper loop: reads mainnet DEX pool prices and pushes them to
 * the corresponding devnet markets via PushAuthMark.
 *
 * Each cycle:
 *   1. For every market in the registry, read the mainnet pool price.
 *      Pool prices are deduplicated: if two markets share a pool, the pool
 *      is fetched only once per cycle.
 *   2. Push (or dry-run) PushAuthMark to the devnet market.
 *   3. Errors are isolated per-market — one bad pool or push does not
 *      abort the rest of the cycle.
 *
 * Health endpoint:
 *   GET /health  →  JSON with per-market stats and service-level counters.
 *   Suitable for Railway / Render health checks.
