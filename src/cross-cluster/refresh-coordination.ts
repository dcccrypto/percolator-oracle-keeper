/**

 *
 * Shared state between the recovery cranker and the push loop, kept in its own
 * module so neither imports the other.
 *
 * 1. Push holds. A no-observation refresh crank is accepted only while the
 *    market's latest pushed mark equals the mark the last accrual used; once a
 *    new PushAuthMark lands, a refresh returns Custom(22) until the next
 *    accrual (which re-stales the whole cohort again). When a market has more
 *    positioned portfolios than one transaction can refresh, the cranker sends
 *    the rest as follow-up transactions and holds that market's pushes until
 *    they land, so they share the accrual's price window. A hold always
 *    expires on its own (`untilMs`), so a cranker that dies mid-hold cannot
 *    freeze a market's price.
 *
 * 2. Per-market crank refresh health, written by the cranker every cycle and
 *    read by the /health handler.
