/**
 * #100 — the market's token must be one side of the pool being priced.
 *
 * The defect this closes: `dex_pool_address` is creator-supplied, and nothing
 * checked that the pool prices the token the market is FOR. `baseMint` was parsed
 * and used only to fetch decimals. A pool for an entirely different token was
 * accepted as the AuthMark every trade settles against.
 *
 * Also pinned here: `mainnet_ca` was already SELECTed by db-markets and then
 * dropped when building the entry, which is why the value existed but the check
 * could not. rowsToEntries carrying it is asserted, because the binding is
 * silently a no-op without it.
