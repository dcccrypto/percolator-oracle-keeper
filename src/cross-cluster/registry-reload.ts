/**
 * cross-cluster/registry-reload.ts
 *
 * G6: registry hot-reload.
 *
 * Without this, the only way for the running keeper to pick up a re-seed
 * (an operator writing a new registry.json after re-running newmarkets.ts /
 * launch-test-market.ts, e.g. to replace a deep-stale market with a fresh
 * one) is to restart the process — and a restart-gap right after a re-seed
 * is exactly the kind of transient boot miss D5 exists to prevent. This
 * lets an operator drop a new registry.json in place and have it picked up
 * within `intervalMs`, live, with zero keeper downtime. Explicitly called
 * out as "Critical for the upcoming re-seed" in the resilience plan.
 *
 * Reconciles the on-disk registry into the SAME in-memory `Registry` object
 * (reassigns `registry.markets` / `registry.description` in place — never
 * replaces the object reference itself). Every consumer (keeper-loop,
 * recovery-cranker, register-poll) holds a reference to that same object and
 * reads `.markets` fresh every cycle (see register-poll.ts's own doc
 * comment), so a hot-reload is visible to all three loops on their very next
 * cycle — exactly like a register-poll addition already is.
 *
 * "Prune dead slabs": any market address present in memory but no longer
 * present on disk is dropped from `registry.markets`. An operator can remove
 * a bad/dead market from registry.json and have the keeper stop
 * cranking/pushing to it without a restart. (Per-market state left behind in
 * the recovery-cranker's internal `states` Map is simply never iterated
 * again once its market is pruned — a harmless, bounded memory footprint,
 * not a correctness issue.)
 *
 * Interval-based (not fs.watch) deliberately: fs.watch is unreliable across
 * platforms/filesystems for atomic-rename-style writes (which is how
 * saveRegistry / most editors / `mv` actually replace a file — the watch can
 * silently miss the swap on some platforms), and a missed watch event would
 * quietly re-introduce the exact restart-gap this exists to close. A cheap
 * poll (one small JSON file read) bounds the worst-case re-seed pickup
 * latency to one interval with no such platform-dependent failure mode.
