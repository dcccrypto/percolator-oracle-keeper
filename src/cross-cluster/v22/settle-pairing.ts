/**
 * cross-cluster/v22/settle-pairing.ts   (policy name: SETTLE_PAIRING)
 *
 * WHY. Measured engine bug (coordinator read-only analysis of the live keeper): `PermissionlessCrank` (tag 5) on a
 * portfolio settles ONLY that portfolio to the previously stored K, then accrues the market to the new mark. A loss
 * is booked as backing at once; the counterparties' gains are not credited until they are settled themselves.
 * Settling the vault LP alone at a price peak therefore strands value. Two keeper patterns do exactly that:
 *   - VaultLpCranker.onPushLanded: a LONE LP observation crank 1.5 s after every landed push whose mark moved;
 *   - the #147 sweep: an LP accrue+settle in EVERY sweep tx, settling each counterparty once per round, so a
 *     counterparty's stale interval is about ceil(P / 10) cycles (P = positioned count) against at most 20 s on the
 *     legacy path.
 * An engine-side fix is designed separately. This policy is DEFENCE IN DEPTH, not the fix.
 *
 * THE POLICY. The LP is never settled in a transaction that does not also settle every counterparty of that asset
 * that fits; the round is ordered so the LP's settle lands in the LAST transaction of the round; every
 * transaction of a round targets the same slot where possible.
 *
 *   off      today's #147 shape: [LP crank, refresh xN] in every tx (no pairing claim).
 *   prefer   (default) pair whenever the round can be completed inside the tx budget; otherwise degrade to the
 *            legacy shape for the overflow and COUNT it (`unpairedLpSettles`, /health).
 *   strict   never settle the LP unpaired: a round that cannot be completed is refused for the LP (counterparties
 *            are still refreshed), the market is reported `pairing-blocked` and the LP waits for the next round.
 *
 * ROUND SHAPES (W = weight budget per tx, a refresh weighs 3 + legs, the LP crank weighs 3 + LP legs):
 *   1. everything fits one tx  -> ONE tx [LP crank (accrue + settle LP), refresh all]. Atomic: same slot. paired.
 *   2. otherwise, N+1 txs, heaviest stale weight first:
 *        tx 1..N   [observation crank on the tx's FIRST counterparty (accrue, settles that counterparty), refresh rest]
 *                  (accrue-only form: see ACCRUE-ONLY below)
 *        tx N+1    [LP crank (accrue + settle LP), refresh the remaining (lightest) counterparties]   <- LP LAST
 *      Phase 1 (tx 1..N) is sent in parallel with one blockhash; phase 2 (the LP tx) is sent only after phase 1
 *      landed, and only if the slot gap is within `maxGapSlots` (else the round is abandoned and re-planned).
 *      Pushes are held for the round so the mark does not move between the phases.
 *
 * ACCRUE-ONLY (the coordinator asked: does a crank exist that accrues WITHOUT settling the LP?)
 *   - The no-observation (refresh) form does NOT accrue: it is accepted only when the asset is already accrued in
 *     the current slot, else EngineNonProgress (Custom(22)). So it is not an accrue-only crank.
 *   - A PermissionlessCrank WITH an observation accrues the market through WHICHEVER portfolio it targets: the wire
 *     (`handle_permissionless_crank_zero_copy`, wrapper release/v22-wrapper-rem) takes `portfolio` as any
 *     market-bound portfolio, not only the LP. So accrue-only exists in two forms:
 *       (a) target a FLAT portfolio (the "anchor"): settles nothing of value. Optional; supplied by
 *           KEEPER_V22_ACCRUE_ANCHORS or discovered (a zero-leg, non-LP portfolio of the market).
 *       (b) target the tx's first COUNTERPARTY: the accrue settles that counterparty, never the LP. Always
 *           available when the tx has a counterparty. This is the default; it also saves that counterparty's
 *           separate refresh.
 *   - NOT VERIFIED without a live v2.2 market: that the engine returns success (not Custom(22)) when the target of
 *     an observation crank is a flat portfolio. The executor simulates first, so a refusal degrades to (b).
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT GUARANTEE (also in the PR body):
 *   1. Multi-tx rounds are not atomic. Between phase 1 landing and the LP tx landing there are g slots
 *      (expected 1-4 slots, about 0.4-1.6 s; hard cap `maxGapSlots`, default 8). Funding / rent keep accruing for
 *      g slots, and any mark push by ANOTHER writer in that window moves K. Our own pushes are held.
 *   2. A single tx round (<= W) is the only exactly-atomic case.
 *   3. Anyone (not the keeper) can still crank the LP alone: tag 5 is permissionless.
 *   4. The positioned set is a read; a portfolio that opens or closes during the round is missed until the next one.
 *   5. If P exceeds `maxTxsPerRound` txs, `prefer` settles the LP with part of the book unvisited (counted),
 *      `strict` does not settle the LP that round.
 *   6. It does not repair the engine bug; it narrows the keeper's own exposure.
